Using the layout we created in the "question.py" program, students should be able to 
create a 10 quiz program. The Program should be able to identify if the user's input is 
acceptable or unacceptable and then if the user's answer is correct or not. 
The program should also be able to run a while loop continuously for incorrect answers 
and exit the loop when an acceptable answer is given. The quiz should have a score to 
keep track of how many answers they have gotten correct and at the end, the program 
should tell the user how many points they got correct.
